.. option:: CONFIG_ETH_SAM_GMAC_NBUF_DATA_COUNT:
.. _CONFIG_ETH_SAM_GMAC_NBUF_DATA_COUNT:

Number of network data buffers that will be permanently allocated by the
Ethernet driver. These data buffers are used in receive path. They are
pre-alocated by the driver and made available to the GMAC module to be
filled in with incoming data. Their number has to be large enough to fit
at least one complete Ethernet frame. SAM ETH driver will always allocate
that amount of buffers for itself thus reducing the NET_NBUF_DATA_COUNT
which is a total amount of data buffers used by the whole networking
stack. One has to ensure that NET_NBUF_DATA_COUNT is large enough to fit
at least two ethernet frames: one being received by the GMAC module and
the other being processed by the higer layer networking stack.
