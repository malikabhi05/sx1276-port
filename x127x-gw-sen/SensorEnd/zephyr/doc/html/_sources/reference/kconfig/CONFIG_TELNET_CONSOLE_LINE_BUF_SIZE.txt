.. _CONFIG_TELNET_CONSOLE_LINE_BUF_SIZE:

This option can be used to modify the size of the buffer storing
console output line, prior to sending it through the network.
Of course an output line can be longer than such size, it just
means sending it will start as soon as it reaches this size.
It really depends on what type of output is expected.
A lot of short lines: better reduce this value. On the contrary,
raise it.
