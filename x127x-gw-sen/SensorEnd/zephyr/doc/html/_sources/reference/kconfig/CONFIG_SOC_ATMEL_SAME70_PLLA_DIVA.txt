This is the divider DIVA used by the PLL.
The processor clock is (MAINCK * (MULA + 1) / DIVA).

Board config file can override this settings
for a particular board.

Setting DIVA=0 would disable PLL at boot, this is currently
not supported.

With default of MULA == 24, and DIVA == 1,
PLL is running at 25 times the main clock frequency.
